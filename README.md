# Build and Run

To build & run the game, use the control center placed in a "control" 
folder. 

There you find all you need to:
1. `build the game data volume` where a data to assembly the game is placed 
2. `build the game` 
3. `start or restart the game` 
4. `delete all` if you're done


# Open site

To open site with the game, use the [next](http://localhost:5000/) url:

http://localhost:5000/

Otherwise, it will be opened in browser by default if you use 
`start or restart the game` command in the control center.
